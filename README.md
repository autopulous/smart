# smart
ANSII C library for memory management, pooling, stack, tokenizing, and tree operations

This is a collection of source code components written in ANSI C that provide basic memory allocation, memory pooling, tokenization, stack, and balanced "red-black" tree operations.

The Red-Black tree implementation (John Leonard Hart IV's algorithm) is unique in that it efficiently self-balances and supports multiple very efficient operations for navigating between nodes in the tree (see: smart.tree.i.h).

# Retirement notice:

The functions in this library have been absorbed and advanced within the MOTEL (Model-Object Tuple-Expression Language) project which can be accessed:
